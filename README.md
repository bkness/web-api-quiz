- **Answer Questions:** Users answer multiple-choice questions.
  - If the user selects a wrong answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer.
  - If the user answers all questions correctly or the timer reaches 0, the "End Quiz" functionality is triggered.
- **End Quiz:** Prompts the user to enter their initials for a high score, which is then saved to local storage.
