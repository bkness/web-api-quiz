I have created a timed quiz using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. The structure meets the acceptance criteria and the project is fully functional.

Here's how it works:

When the "Start Quiz" button is submitted, a timer begins counting down from 100 seconds.
*If the user answers all questions correctly or the timer reaches 0, the "End Quiz" functionality initiates.
*If the user selects a wrong answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer.
*Finally, if the timer reaches 0 or the user guesses correctly within the allotted time, the "endQuiz" function is triggered. This function prompts the user to enter their initials for a high score, which is then saved to local storage.

I've also included detailed comments within the code to explain the functionality.

Here's a screenshot of the project:
